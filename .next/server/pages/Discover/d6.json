{"pageProps":{"DestinationDetails":{"id":"d6","category":"Historical","city":"Aswan","description":"The famous rock temples built by Pharaoh Ramses II stand as one of the greatest engineering and artistic achievements of ancient Egypt. Carved directly into a sandstone cliff during the 13th century BCE, these monumental temples were constructed to honor Ramses II and the gods Amun-Ra, Ra-Horakhty, Ptah, and the deified Ramses himself. The main temple is renowned for its four colossal seated statues of Ramses II guarding the entrance, symbolizing royal power, divine authority, and Egypt’s dominance during the New Kingdom.  Originally located at Abu Simbel in southern Egypt, the temples faced a major threat in the 1960s with the construction of the Aswan High Dam, which would have submerged them under the rising waters of Lake Nasser. In an extraordinary international effort led by UNESCO, the temples were carefully dismantled block by block, each weighing several tons, and relocated to higher ground nearby. The relocation preserved not only the structures but also their precise orientation, ensuring the famous solar alignment phenomenon—where sunlight illuminates the inner sanctuary statues twice a year—remained intact.  Today, the Abu Simbel temples are a powerful symbol of ancient Egyptian ingenuity and modern engineering collaboration. They attract visitors from around the world who come to admire their monumental scale, detailed reliefs depicting military victories and religious scenes, and the remarkable story of their rescue. The temples offer a profound insight into the legacy of Ramses II and the determination to protect humanity’s shared cultural heritage.","image":"/trips/Abu-Simbel.jpg","name":"Abu Simbel Temples","price":1500,"rating":4.8,"shortDescription":"Famous rock temples built by Ramses II, relocated to avoid flooding from the Aswan High Dam.","slug":"Abu-Simble-Temples"}},"__N_SSG":true}
