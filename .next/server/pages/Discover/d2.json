Dedicated primarily to the god Amun-Ra, it features vast courtyards, towering pylons, massive columns, and colossal statues that reflect the power and devotion of ancient Egyptian civilization.  Located in Luxor, Karnak was developed over more than two thousand years by successive pharaohs, making it a living record of Egypt’s religious and political history. The Great Hypostyle Hall, with its enormous stone columns, is one of the most breathtaking architectural achievements in the ancient world.  Today, the Karnak Temple Complex is a major tourist attraction, offering visitors a powerful insight into ancient Egyptian beliefs, monumental architecture, and the grandeur of a civilization that shaped human history.","image":"/trips/karnak-temple.jpeg","isFeatured":true,"name":"Karnak Temple","price":900,"rating":4.8,"shortDescription":"The largest religious complex in ancient Egypt with massive columns and statues"}},"__N_SSG":true}
